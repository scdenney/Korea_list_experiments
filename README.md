The abstract is as follows:

>A substantial body of research has found that social desirability motivates respondents to overstate support for immigration when asked directly, but when provided an unobtrusive means of expressing preferences, support declines. In this paper, we ask whether South Koreans follow this pattern, especially with regards to co-ethnic migrants from North Korea and China. We use list experiments to determine whether observed levels of support for general immigration and co-ethnic migration are biased by social desirability. We find that generally respondents overstate their support for co-ethnics from North Korea by a significant amount when asked directly, but not for the other groups, although college-educated respondents overstate their support for general immigration. Social desirability bias with respect to co-ethnics from North Korea is particularly evident in older respondents and males. These findings challenge the notion that native-born citizens prefer co-ethnic immigrants. 

There are three data files, two replication code files, and one variable description file.

# Data
- "PanelA.Rdata, "PanelB.RData," and "PanelC.RData" are the data files for each panel analyzed in the paper.

# R code
- "Reproduce_difference-in-means.R" contains R code needed to replicate the difference-in-means graph(s) for the list experiments.
- "Reproduce_multivariate analysis.R" contains R code necessary to replicate the multivariate analysis (MLE models) for the list experiments.

# Variable description
- "Variable description" describes variables in all data files.
